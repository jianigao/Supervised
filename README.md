## Supervised Learning Algorithms

This repository includes supervised learning algorithms using machine learning and deep learning techniques for two kinds of problems:

* Regression: to predict continuous numerical values, e.g. housing price prediction
  + Decision tree
  + Linear regression
  + Random forests
  + XGBoost
  + Neural networks
* Classification: to predict discrete values (i.e. binary values like 0/1, yes/no, true/false), e.g. credit card approval
  + Decision tree
  + K nearest neighbors
  + Logistic regression
  + Naive Bayes
  + Random forests
  + Neural networks
