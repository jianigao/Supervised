## Supervised Learning Algorithms

This repository includes supervised learning algorithms using machine learning and deep learning techniques for two kinds of problems:

* Regression (e.g. Housing price prediction):
  + Decision tree
  + Linear regression
  + Random forest
  + XGBoost
  + Neural networks
* Classification (e.g. Credit card approval):
  + Decision tree
  + K nearest neighbors
  + Logistic regression
  + Naive Bayes
  + Random forest
  + Neural networks
